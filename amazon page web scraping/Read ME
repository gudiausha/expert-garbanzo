The motive is to get the price and name of the product(mobile) from the amazon webpage, and further log it into a file. The constraint is that 
for every 30 minutes of running the script, the information must get logged into a new file. The input is given in the form of url. The url
is the product page whose name and price the user wants to download.

INPUT: python filename.py "url" //when using JupyterLabs: INPUT:!ipython 'filename.ipynb' "url"
OUTPUT: Date(yyyy/mm/dd):Time:Product Name: Product Price 

The input is given via command prompt and for this argparse module(sys module can also be used) is used. Then with the help of beautiful
soup,the html page is parsed and the output is given. 

Note: In the output image, the date and time are not in sync with the IST, this is because of the server in which i got my jupyterlab 
notebook. The code has been written for amazon.in website, i guess it can be used for amazon.com also(do try and let me know)

Futher changes which can be made are: 
1.The whole code can be divided into functions for easier understanding. 
2.In the code I have spilt the name so it can take only the first 10 characters, this may cause a problem is the name of the product is 
  greater than 10, so using regex module it can coded such that only the exact name of the product appears.

Modules learnt:
1.Logging 
2.Argparse 
3.Beautiful Soup
4.Requests
